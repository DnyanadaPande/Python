Python codes.

Author: Dnyanada Pande

This repository has Python codes that were a part of my graduate coursework and other codes that I use for data processing tasks.

1. CircosInput.py - This code takes in a input file with blat alignment results for reads and extracts the chromosome number, position and the strand from them and writes the results into a csv file.

2. EditingFrequency.py - This file reads in results of multiple seqeunce alignment, searches for a specific pattern and calculates frequency.
